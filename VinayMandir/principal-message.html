                        Our founder Padmabhushan (Late) Shri Karamshi Jethabhai Somaiya, the great visionary, firmly
                        believed that modern education should be value based and strong on ethics. Dr. Shantilal Somaiya
                        carried that legacy forward and the legacy in now being nurtured under the dynamic and visionary
                        leadership of Shri Samirbhai Somaiya who is implementing the best practices from universities
                        across the world.

                            Our students have won national and international laurels in the field of sports.
                            At SKSVM we have been blessed with an experienced and dedicated faculty who take great pride
                            and joy in teaching students and being their mentors in more ways than one.
                            The importance of one’s mother tongue can never be overemphasised and the role it plays in a
                            child’s education. We at SKSVM understand the importance of a child learning in one’s mother
                            tongue. Somaiya’s have encouraged and nurtured this method of learning and our Gujarati
                            Medium Secondary School bears testimony to this fact.

                        The methods of how knowledge is imparted and received are evolving rapidly in these times of a
                        digitally connected world. We at SKSVM encourage teachers and students to use digital media and
                        web based methods to communicate and learn as and when required. Seminars and workshops are
                        organised for teachers on the campus to keep our teachers abreast of the changing scenarios in
                        the field of education.
