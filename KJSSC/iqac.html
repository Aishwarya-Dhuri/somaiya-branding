                        <p>
                            As per the guidelines set by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC),
                            Bangalore, every accredited institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell
                            (IQAC) as a quality sustenance measure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The IQAC at K. J. Somaiya College of Science and Commerce is an integral part of the
                            institute and committed for the continuous quality enhancement as per the NAAC guiding
                            principles. The prime task of our IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and
                            catalytic improvement in the overall performance of the institution. We have focused our
                            efforts and measures towards promoting holistic academic excellence through this cell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every constituent of the IQAC adds value to this unit with their active participation and
                            sense of ownership. The IQAC at K. J. Somaiya College of Science and Commerce is not an
                            additional hierarchy but a system that encourages everyone to contribute in the ongoing
                            quest for quality.</p>
