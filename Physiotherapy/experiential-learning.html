                            Other than clinical exposure in Somaiya hospital, it is important for students to experience and understand various other factors (eg:vocation) required for complete rehabilitation of a patient. It is also essential for them to visualize and learn about special groups of patients ( eg: burns, cancer) with different rehabilitation needs. Hence the college arranges visits to specific National rehabilitation centers which helps to widen their outlook.
