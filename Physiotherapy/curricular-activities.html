                                 <p>Regular lectures and seminars are conducted for undergraduate students. Tutorials are taken for students with special needs. Hands on teaching is conducted during practical sessions by individual faculty. Postgraduate students participate in seminars where they present individual syllabus topics in the presence of faculty facilitators. Also there are activities such as journal club and critical appraisal to facilitate research aptitude amongst PG students.
